# Theory 
Circular convolution is a mathematical operation which is like Linear Convolution but particularly useful in Discrete Time Signal Processing where signals are often periodic.
Mathematically, 

$$
x_1(n) * x_2(n) = \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x_1(m) x_2((n-m) \mod N)
$$

where x1(n) and x2(n) are two periodic sequences

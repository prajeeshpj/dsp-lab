# Theory
Sampling Theorem states that a band limited signal can be reconstructed exactly if it is sampled at a rate atleast twice the maximum frequency component in it. The maximum frequency component of g(t) is fm. To recover the signal g(t) exactly from its samples it has to be sampled at a rate fs=2fm. The minimum required sampling rate fs = 2fm is called Nyquist rate
